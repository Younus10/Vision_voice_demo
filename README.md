Ah, perfect! That’s actually a **key context** that makes your project more meaningful. You can include a **“Concept / Motivation”** section to explain the idea behind the project — basically how it mimics “smart spectacles” for visually impaired users.

Here’s a **full polished README** ready for copy-paste, including that section:

# YOLO Video Analysis with Voice Summary

## Concept / Motivation
This project demonstrates a prototype of **smart spectacles** that can help visually impaired users understand their surroundings.  
By uploading a short video (simulating what the spectacles capture), the system:

- Detects objects in the scene.
- Provides a **friendly text description** of what’s around.
- Converts the description to **speech** so a user can hear it.

Think of it as a **vision-to-voice system** that translates visual information into audible, meaningful feedback.

---

## Overview
The system automatically generates:

1. **Annotated frames** showing detected objects.
2. **Text summary** of the objects detected in a natural, friendly sentence.
3. **Audio narration** of the summary using text-to-speech.

It uses **YOLOv8 (medium)** for object detection, OpenCV for video processing, and **Gradio** for a web interface.

---

## Features
- Extracts key frames from the video for faster processing.
- Enhances brightness & contrast of frames for better detection.
- Detects multiple objects and aggregates them into a human-readable summary.
- Generates **friendly text summaries** like:  
  *"It looks like you're near a bottle, a mouse, and a cell phone."*
- Converts the summary to audio using `gTTS`.
- Displays **annotated frames** with bounding boxes and labels.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolo_video_analysis.git
cd yolo_video_analysis
````

2. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the YOLOv8 medium model (`yolov8m.pt`) from [Ultralytics YOLOv8 release page](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/releases) and place it in the project root.

---

## Usage

Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

* Open `http://127.0.0.1:7860` in your browser.
* Upload a short video (mp4 recommended).
* Click **Process Video**.
* View the annotated frame, text summary, and listen to the audio narration.

---

## Customization

* **YOLO model**: Change `YOLO("yolov8m.pt")` to `yolov8n.pt` for faster but less accurate detection.
* **Frame sampling**: Adjust `step` and `max_frames` in `extract_sampled_frames()` for faster/slower analysis.
* **Friendly summary**: Toggle `friendly=True/False` in `aggregate_detections()` to control tone.

---

## Notes

* Works best with videos where objects are clearly visible.
* Supports multiple objects per frame.
* Ensure your environment can play audio for `gTTS` output.
* You can add sample videos in the `assets/` folder for testing.

This version:  
- Explains the **smart spectacles concept**.  
- Shows practical **installation, usage, and customization** steps.  
- Maintains **professional readability** for GitHub.  

If you want, I can also **rewrite it with emojis and nicer Markdown formatting** to make it **look more modern and visually appealing** for GitHub users.  

Do you want me to do that?
